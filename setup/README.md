# Requirements and Setup

## Java JDK

You need a Java JDK version 11 or higher

## Kubernetes

In general, you should be able to run all demos on current Kubernetes cluster versions
at least supporting pod security contexts.

For local Kubernetes provisioning you may use [K3s](https://k3s.io) that runs on Linux systems (without using a VM) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) as a cross-platform solution running on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

For installation just follow the instructions on the [K3s](https://k3s.io) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) web sites.

### Minikube

To start Minikube just type:

```shell
minikube start
```

If you want to use local images to be deployed to minikube
then you need to point the docker registry to the one inside minikube.

```shell
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

With a _docker ps_ command you can check if you are using the intended docker registry.

```shell
docker ps
```

You can stop Minikube again using:

```shell
minikube stop
```

For full details please consult the [minikube docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

### K3s

For Linux users the easiest way to provision a Kubernetes locally is done as follows:

```shell
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

After waiting for a short time (takes maybe about 30 seconds) you have a Kubernetes cluster ready to use.
Just try this to make sure it works:

```bash
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
```

Unfortunately as of now this requires root privileges. Currently, K3s provides Rootless support only as an _experimental_ feature.

To stop the Kubernetes server just type:

```bash
k3s-killall.sh
```

To stop it and get rid of the installation just type:

```bash
k3s-uninstall.sh
```

### Managed Kubernetes Cluster

To use all features of an enterprise grade Kubernetes cluster you have to go into the cloud and use
one of the well-known providers:

* Microsoft Azure with [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service)
* Amazon AWS with [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)
* Google Cloud with [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

The [gke-provisioning](../gke-provisioning) directory contains
scripts to create a kubernetes cluster on google cloud GKE.
There is also a script to update the cluster to enable pod security policy.

To use the scripts you must have the Google cloud cli installed and be logged in
to GCP.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project [project]
```

Please update the provided scripts according to your google cloud project and the target zone
you want to use before executing these!
