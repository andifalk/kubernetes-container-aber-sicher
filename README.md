## Requirements and Setup

### Java JDK

You need a Java JDK version 11 or higher

### Kubernetes

In general, you should be able to run all demos on current Kubernetes cluster versions
at least supporting pod security contexts.

For local Kubernetes provisioning you may use [K3s](https://k3s.io) that runs on Linux systems (without using a VM) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) as a cross-platform solution running on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

For installation just follow the instructions on the [K3s](https://k3s.io) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) web sites.

#### Minikube

To start Minikube just type:

```shell
minikube start
```

If you want to use local images to be deployed to minikube 
then you need to point the docker registry to the one inside minikube.

```shell
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

With a _docker ps_ command you can check if you are using the intended docker registry.
 
```shell
docker ps
```

You can stop Minikube again using:

```shell
minikube stop
```

For full details please consult the [minikube docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

#### K3s

For Linux users the easiest way to provision a Kubernetes locally is done as follows:

```shell
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

After waiting for a short time (takes maybe about 30 seconds) you have a Kubernetes cluster ready to use.
Just try this to make sure it works:

```bash
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
```

Unfortunately as of now this requires root privileges. Currently, K3s provides Rootless support only as an _experimental_ feature. 

To stop the Kubernetes server just type:

```bash
k3s-killall.sh
```

To stop it and get rid of the installation just type:

```bash
k3s-uninstall.sh
```

#### Managed Kubernetes Cluster

To use all features of an enterprise grade Kubernetes cluster you have to go into the cloud and use
one of the well-known providers:

* Microsoft Azure with [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service)
* Amazon AWS with [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)
* Google Cloud with [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

The [gke-provisioning](gke-provisioning) directory contains
scripts to create a kubernetes cluster on google cloud GKE.
There is also a script to update the cluster to enable pod security policy.

To use the scripts you must have google cloud cli installed and be logged in
to GCP.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project [project]
```

Please update the provided scripts according to your google cloud project and the target zone 
you want to use before executing these!

## Helpful Tools for K8s Security

### Kube-Score for Static Code Analysis

Kube-score is a tool that performs static code analysis of your Kubernetes object definitions (i.e. your YAML files).
You can install it from [Kube-Score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score).

Now you can just verify e.g. a deployment definition like this:

```shell
kube-score score ./deploy.yaml
```

### Trivy for Image Scan

As part of the demos we will also scan our container images for OS and Application vulnerabilities
using an open source tool named [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).

For installation instructions just browse to the [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) website.

Trivy is very easy to use locally and inside your CI/CD system. If you want to have a more enterprise grade tool
you may look for the [Harbour Registry](https://goharbor.io) (including the Clair image scanner) or a commercial tool like [Snyk](https://snyk.io).

### Kubeaudit for Kubernetes Security Audits

As part of the demos we will also check our Kubernetes for security issues like container running
with root rights using an open source tool named [Kubeaudit](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit).

For installation instructions just browse to the [Kubeaudit](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit) website.

### Popeye - A Kubernetes Cluster Sanitizer

Popeye is a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and reports potential issues with deployed resources and configurations.
Just head to the [Popeye website](https://github.com/derailed/popeye) to install it.

With that you just _Popeye_ a cluster using your current kubeconfig environment by typing:

```shell
popeye
```

### Who-Can for Auditing RBAC

[Kubernetes' Role Based Access (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) is not easy. A recommended helpful tool for auditing RBAC configuration is [AqueSecurity Who-Can](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can).  
Just follow the instructions on the [Who-Can website](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can) to install this.

After installing, you may for example just check who can create pods:

```shell
kubectl who-can create pods
```

### Look up role bindings with RBAC lookup

[RBAC Lookup](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/rbac-lookup) is a CLI that allows you to easily find Kubernetes roles and cluster roles bound to any user, service account, or group name.

With RBAC lookup you can just query for example the role bindings of the _default_ service account:

```shell
kubectl rbac-lookup default -k serviceaccount -o wide
```
